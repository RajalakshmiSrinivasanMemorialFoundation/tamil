<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>மாணவர் பெல்லோஷிப்கள்</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word">The Foundation has initiated a Student Fellowship Program (SFP) to strengthen and expand [<span style="text-decoration: underline">our work with the schools</span>](../schools/). Under this, we offer Fellowships to College students , with or without a stipend, to enable them to work with us on our activities  with the schools, and for which a Certificate will be issued. The program has been launched initially with the MIT Campus of Anna University at Chromepet , as many of the persons associated with the Foundation have had long ties with this institution. Under this, Fellowships with a stipend of Rs.4000/- per month are awarded to the MIT students residing in the Hostels inside the campus - initially for a period of six months , but extendable further based on performance. The Fellows will spend 3-4 hours a week working in the nearby schools as directed by the Foundation. If the donor supports a Fellow for  a 2 year period or more, then the Fellowship can carry the name of the donor along with that of the Foundation. Please see [<span style="text-decoration: underline">here</span>](../assets/rajifoundation_fellowship_appeal.pdf) for an Appeal issued by the Foundation seeking financial contributions to support the SFP in the MIT Campus.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word">If the alumni of other institutions are willing to contribute, then similar Fellowship programs can be started in their colleges also.</p>
